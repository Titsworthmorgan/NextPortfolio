## Overview

As the lead developer for The Plumbing Authority, I spearheaded a complete web overhaul aimed at enhancing the company's online presence and user experience. This project involved rearchitecting the website using Next.js to boost performance, integrating new content management capabilities, and establishing a consistent visual identity.

## Key Features

- **Complete Web Overhaul**: Redesigned and restructured the website using Next.js, focusing on performance, accessibility, and user experience.
- **Analytics Integration**: Set up a robust analytics solution to capture key insights and inform strategic decisions with data-driven metrics.
- **MUI Theming**: Developed a theming system using Material-UI to maintain a cohesive visual style and improve responsiveness across all devices.
- **Sanity Integration**: Implemented Sanity as a headless CMS, allowing the client to easily manage and update content without developer intervention.
- **Lead Automation**: Implemented automation features to streamline lead generation and improve customer engagement.

## Technologies Used

- **Next.js**: For fast, server-rendered React applications.
- **Figma**: For creating and managing design assets and prototypes.
- **Material-UI**: For a modular and responsive theming approach.
- **Sanity**: To create a scalable and intuitive content management system.
- **Vercel Analytics**: For comprehensive tracking and performance insights.

## Challenges and Learnings

The primary challenge of this project was to balance the demands of a dynamic content system while ensuring a consistent user experience. Integrating Sanity and establishing a robust theming approach with Material-UI required close collaboration with the design team to achieve visual consistency. Additionally, setting up analytics and automation features involved aligning multiple stakeholders on key objectives and priorities.

## Outcome

The newly revamped website for The Plumbing Authority has resulted in improved user engagement, increased content management flexibility, and a cohesive brand experience. The project has successfully modernized the company's online presence and set the stage for future scalability and growth.
