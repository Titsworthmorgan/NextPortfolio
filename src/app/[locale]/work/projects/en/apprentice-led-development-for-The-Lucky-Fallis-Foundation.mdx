## Overview

For The Lucky Fallis Foundation, I served as a mentor and development supervisor, guiding a group of six new apprentices in their journey to become web developers. This project was centered around teaching foundational skills while overseeing the technical development and collaborating with stakeholders to meet the non-profit’s goals.

## Key Features

- **Apprenticeship Training Program**: Conducted hands-on training sessions, covering core web development concepts, best practices, and collaborative workflows.
- **Project Management and Oversight**: Worked closely with the team lead to provide oversight and ensure alignment with the project’s goals, technical standards, and deadlines.
- **Stakeholder Collaboration**: Engaged with key stakeholders to capture requirements and incorporate feedback throughout the development process, fostering clear communication channels.
- **Development Strategy and Guidance**: Helped apprentices learn and apply front-end and back-end skills in a practical project environment, focusing on effective coding practices and problem-solving techniques.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: For building dynamic, responsive user interfaces.
- **Material-UI**: For a modular and responsive theming approach.
- **Sanity**: To create a scalable and intuitive content management system.
- **Figma**: For creating and managing design assets and prototypes.

## Challenges and Learnings

The primary challenge was balancing the dual responsibilities of mentorship and project oversight. Guiding new developers from the ground up while maintaining project momentum required a structured curriculum, frequent code reviews, and clear communication. Establishing an iterative feedback loop between the team, stakeholders, and developers ensured that project expectations and goals were met.

## Outcome

The Lucky Fallis Foundation website was successfully launched, providing a robust online platform for the non-profit. The apprentices not only contributed to a real-world project but also gained critical web development skills and hands-on experience working within a team. This project created a valuable foundation for their future careers and delivered a meaningful solution for the organization.
