## Overview

I served as a developer for a project called The Futurist, a project that involved a complete website overhaul to support and showcase the podcast. The focus was on creating a scalable platform that not only highlights episode content but also drives SEO performance. We utilized a modern tech stack that integrated Sanity for content management, Next.js for performance and API integration, and MUI for theming.

## Key Features

- **Podcast Episode Integration**: We integrated The Futurist’s full episode listings into the website by leveraging Next.js’s API routes. This allowed us to fetch XML feeds hosted on Blubrry and dynamically update episodes.
- **Sanity CMS**: Implemented Sanity as the content management system, giving the team an intuitive way to manage all podcast-related content, metadata, and site pages.
- **Modular CSS**: Implemented module CSS for a scalable and maintainable approach to styling, ensuring a consistent design language across the site.
- **SEO Focus**: Optimized the site using Next.js’s built-in features and dynamic metadata handling to improve discoverability and search engine rankings.

## Technologies Used

- **Next.js**: For server-side rendering, API integration, and SEO improvements.
- **Module CSS**: For modular and scoped styling.
- **Sanity**: To provide a flexible and headless content management solution.
- **Blubrry API**: To fetch podcast episode feeds in XML format and render them dynamically.

## Challenges and Learnings

One key challenge was creating a seamless integration between the Blubrry podcast feeds and the website. We leveraged Next.js’s API routes to fetch and format XML data, ensuring episode listings were always up-to-date. Managing SEO across dynamically generated content pages was another focus area, which involved close coordination between content strategy and development to maximize site visibility.

## Outcome

The new website for The Futurist podcast successfully enhanced the user experience by streamlining episode listings and improving overall discoverability. The revamped platform also enabled easier content updates and provided a consistent and engaging way to showcase the podcast’s episodes, helping to drive audience growth.
