## Overview

I served as a middle manager developer for roberttercek.com, a project centered on revamping Robert Tercek’s personal portfolio website. The goal was to enhance his online presence and support his business development initiatives. We utilized a modern tech stack to achieve a clean, responsive, and SEO-optimized platform.

## Key Features

- **Complete Web Overhaul**: Developed a new portfolio site using Next.js, improving performance, interactivity, and user experience.
- **Strapi Integration**: Leveraged Strapi as the headless CMS to provide a flexible content management system, enabling the client to easily update and manage portfolio content.
- **Modular CSS**: Implemented module CSS for a scalable and maintainable approach to styling, ensuring a consistent design language across the site.
- **Metadata Management**: Employed React Helmet to dynamically manage metadata, enhancing SEO and ensuring proper indexing of key pages.

## Technologies Used

- **Next.js**: For building a server-rendered, performant website with a strong focus on SEO.
- **Strapi**: To provide a dynamic and customizable content management solution.
- **Module CSS**: For modular and scoped styling.
- **React Helmet**: To handle SEO and metadata efficiently.

## Challenges and Learnings

A primary challenge was implementing a flexible yet consistent design approach while managing content updates and SEO optimization. Collaborating across development teams and ensuring the integration between front-end and back-end technologies required careful planning and testing. Additionally, aligning with the client’s vision for business growth and branding presented unique requirements.

## Outcome

The newly launched portfolio website provided Robert Tercek with a modern, engaging platform to showcase his work and expertise. The overhaul led to improved site performance, streamlined content updates, and a boost in SEO, ultimately supporting his business development objectives.
